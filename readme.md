# Local Setup

This is a list of what I currently use on my dev machine

## Philosophy

The idea of my setup is to have all my config in one centralised place. This in turns allows my to easierly access what I have and what I need to update.

## List of what I use

#### Pakcage Managers

* Homebrew <br/>
    &nbsp; A centrialised package manager which contains a list of useful settings or languages
* RVM <br/>
    &nbsp; A Ruby version manager if I ever decide to work on a ruby project
* NVM <br/>
    &nbsp; A Node version manager to quickly download, install and switch node

#### Terminal

* HyperTerm <br/>
    &nbsp; My personal choice of terminal because of the Hyper package manager and its look

* iTerm <br/>
    &nbsp; De-facto go to terminal on Mac

- - -

#### Envoiroment tools

* Valet <br/>
    &nbsp; Valet is from Laravel as a new way os setting up a localhost without much configuration
* Docker <br/>
    &nbsp; Docker is instaled via the Docker app

#### Command Line Shell

* Bash <br/>
    &nbsp; De-facto command Line Shell, useful when I am SSH into my pesonal servers
* Zsh <br/>
    &nbsp; Current Command Line Shell that I use, great when Oh-My-Zsh is installed
* Fish <br/>
    &nbsp; Alterate Command Line Shell that I want to use
