# Local Setup

This is a list of what I currently use on my dev machine

## Philosophy

The idea of my setup is to have all my config in one centralised place. This in turns allows my to easierly access what I have and what I need to update.

## List of what I use

#### Pakcage Managers

* Homebrew
    A centrialised package manager which contains a list of useful settings or languages
* RVM
    A Ruby version manager if I ever decide to work on a ruby project
* NVM
    A Node version manager to quickly download, install and switch node

<hr/>

#### Terminal

* HyperTerm
    My personal choice of terminal because of the Hyper package manager and its look

* iTerm
    De-facto go to terminal on Mac

<hr/>

#### Envoiroment tools

* Valet
    Valet is from Laravel as a new way os setting up a localhost without much configuration
* Docker
    Docker is instaled via the Docker app

<hr/>

#### Command Line Shell

* Bash
    De-facto command Line Shell, useful when I am SSH into my pesonal servers
* Zsh
    Current Command Line Shell that I use, great when Oh-My-Zsh is installed
* Fish
    Alterate Command Line Shell that I want to use
